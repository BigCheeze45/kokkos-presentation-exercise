The makefile is setup to look for Kokkos-2.02.07 in /usr/local. If you have a different version or Kokkos is stored in a different directory simply update KOKKOS_PATH in the makefile.

There are two versions of the vector add problem. One implementation is vanilla and the other is implemented in Kokkos. Rename the appropriate makefile and source file to run it.
